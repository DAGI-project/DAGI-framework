# DAGI

**Official core repository of the Directed Acyclic Graph Informational (DAGI) framework**

> Representing quantum and complex-system histories as information graphs, with tools for higher-order synergies, emergent geometry, and constraint-based control.

### What is DAGI?
DAGI is a practical framework that treats physical processes as **directed acyclic graphs** of informational states and records. Key capabilities:
- Formal ontology of branching, decoherence, and coherent record erasure
- Möbius inversion for irreducible higher-order information content (HOIC)
- Mappings to emergent spacetime geometry and curvature proxies
- Hardware-validated primitives (generalized record rate / time dilation)
- Applied extensions to biology and control (constraint interfaces, erasers & knobs)

### Current status (February 2026)
- Core theory and validation notebooks in active development  
- arXiv preprints forthcoming (quant-ph / gr-qc)  
- Provisional patents filed protecting core methods

### Repository contents (initial)
- `/docs` – theory notes and glossary  
- `/notebooks` – HOIC computation examples (coming soon)  
- `/examples` – basic usage scripts  

Full open-source release of non-patented components will follow arXiv publication.

### Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DAGI-project/dagi.git
cd dagi
