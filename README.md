### A unified framework for informational processes across physics, computation, and biology

DAGI models physical and informational histories as **directed acyclic graphs** of states and records, with branching governed by durable records and merging enabled by coherent erasure. Core tools include Möbius-based higher-order information content (HOIC), emergent geometry mappings, and constraint-based control primitives.

**Status**  
- Foundational papers in final preparation for arXiv (quant-ph / gr-qc).  
- U.S. provisional patents filed (priority secured).  
- Open-source resources launching now.
